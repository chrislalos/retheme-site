I believe that a strong, egoless, and excited engineering culture is a key factor in delivering amazing ideas/products.  Let me explain:

When engineers are allowed to "play" for a living, given proper challenges, learning opportunities, autonomy/ownership, etc., they tend to come up
with amazing, clever ideas, and build better products for the world AND the company.  This comes from several key elements:

## Company Vision
It all starts here.  Let's call this the "Party Factor" for lack of a better term.  If the employee gets asked at a party "so, what do you do?", would they be legitimately excited to share the company they work for?  How they change the world for the better?  Will they say "it's just a job"?  Even worse, will they avoid the topic for fear of judgement by their peers (e.g. oil and gas, ad-tech)?  Try to see this challenge through the eyes of your actual talent pool, rather than your [perhaps rose-colored] founder eyes!

## Hiring
The next step is hiring the *right* people.  Hiring takes time, and I've seen more than a few companies fail from rushing this process to merely get "boots on the ground", with the idea that engineering output is the only metric that matters.  When these early/rushed hires don't work out, they either languish, unwanted, on teams until their eventual exit, or being released by the company. Here's the problem... BOTH are toxic for the engineering culture.  I have a less-traditional approach to hiring, with aims on finding the right attitude/passion, rather than fixating on hard technical skills above all else (these can easily be taught to the right) talent.

## Encourage/Inspire
Once you have them, it's all about retention.  So how do you retain top talent?  Assuming you started with an inspiring product vision (step 1), and can afford to [over]pay them enough, you next need to understand the mind of a super-nerd.  We're a rather special breed, tending to treat work and play almost synonymously. We get to solve puzzles and learn for a living, play with new toys/tech constantly, and somehow get paid handsomely for it.  So what "shiny" new tech can we offer this incoming talent?  Something they were already interested in adopting/learning?  Something they're familiar with already?  Can we give them further learning opportunities?  Send them to tech conferences?  Give them play/exploration time for their own ideas?  Encourage sharing/collaboration?
