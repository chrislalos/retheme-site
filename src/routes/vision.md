One thing I absolutely love is turning napkin sketches and ideas into technical reality.

If I can build it, I'll let you know.  If I can't (or someone else can do it better), I'll also let you know.  Want an atractive app/site before hiring a design team?  Not a problem, I happen to be an artist.  Need to hire a team to carry the torch/expand?  I've been doing that since my Chevron days!

Here are a few of the startups I've run or projects I've worked on over the years:

---

## **FindThatStyle** (2010-2012) -
  World's first (as far as we knew) TV-fashion visual search engine, catalogging tens of popular shows, hundreds of actors/actresses, and many thousands of items.  With two other founding partners from my Chevron days, we designed and built a crowd-sourced search engine to connect TV viewers with the designers and fashion apparel they were seeking.  Before eventually closing the company, we had as many as thirty interns, and were courted by worldwide fashion designers and the CW network.

## **Quantum Reservoir Impact** (2014-2015) -
  Overhauled the software development efforts of the company.  Originally hired to transform a largely-academic prototype for reservoir diagnostics/analytics from a 10,000-line, spaghetti code single file "application", this turned into a complete rework of how they designed/built software.  After fully modernizing their stack, then architecting and building the initial app, I hired the junior talent to train and take over the development so I could move on to new ventures!

## **Arundo Analytics** (2017-2021) -
  Led product teams through technical vision, and unified the fragmented (trans-ocean) teams through common prototyping tools and component/build/design systems.  While working towards these goals, I was fortune to work with some of the most fantastic colleagues, many of whom I'm still in touch with today.  Left in late 2021 after launching a major commercial application for industrial monitoring and failure detection.  Super stoked with what we built, and the bar we set for how performant [read: FAST] and slick an "engineering" app could be.

## **Slick.af** (2020-2021)
  Launched a free, public Instagram-clone service for my own uses (as a photographer), around the idea of the lazy photographer/artist being able to drag some files into a folder on their desktop/phone, and a website would magically appear for sharing/viewing those online (in a sexy, magazine-like/iOS sort of way).  Slick accomplishes exactly this.  Submitted this for Y-Combinator in 2021, and will likely revisit after some concept overhaul in 2022.

## **Independent Research** (2021-2022)
  Created a platform for developing/training neuro-evolved continuous control agents for performing a variety of tasks (e.g. drone flight, target-seeking, crypto-trading).  Starting with a sandbox physics simulator to visually confirm that the agents were, in fact, learning what I'd designed them to learn, to a full-blown system to evolve generations of crypto-traders, this project ran the full course of "holy crap this is cool as f!".  Would love to give some demos of  what I built and what it can mean for... well anyone!
