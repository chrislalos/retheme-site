  <title>Automation - Kevin R. Whitley</title>
</svelte:head>

I'll confess - I'm lazy.  Or rather... I *really* don't like to waste my own time (which is my most precious resource), and I assume others don't as well.

To this end, I've always had an obsession with process optimization/efficiency (balanced with ROI).  At Chevron, I transformed a fully-manual intranet migration path to fully-automatic, allowing us to turn months of labor into seconds, at enormous savings to our internal clients, and the company at large.

I've been doing this ever since.

I target the biggest time killers/blocks, and systematically remove them.  My goal isn't [directly] higher output or to refill everyone's time bucket with different tasks, it's simply the reclamation of time.  If a person wastes 1 hour per day in a mundane, thankless task, and we can simply give them back that hour to do *anything*, they'll be happier, more likely to get their other tasks done, and in general, more productive during the remaining hours.  You've simply removed a tax from their life!  Of course, the end effect is this:  As people's time blocks are removed, they find themselves naturally wanting to justify their fat paycheck, so they'll fill the new gaps with learning, experimentation, and process automation of their own.  Encourage/reward this, and the engineering team thrives while the company profits!
