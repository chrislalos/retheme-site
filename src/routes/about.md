I'm an artist, a developer, a creator...

...and I'm helping build a better world, one app/package/idea at a time.

When not coding/thinking about code, I spend the remainder of my free time relaxing with video games/VR, photography, playing with our pup, or simply traveling around the world with my amazing partner, Aimee.
