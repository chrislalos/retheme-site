One thing I absolutely love is turning napkin sketches and ideas into technical reality!

Here are a few of the startups I've run or projects I've worked on over the years:

## Chevron (2006-2010)
It's true... I started my career in enterprise.  I operated with tight constraints and heavy tech restrictions, which encouraged my to find "creative" solutions/workarounds to limitations.  It also taught me office politics, how to lead/teach, and how to tactfully target enormous time wasters/inefficiencies in the process workflow to basically just make everyone's lives easier.

## FindThatStyle (2010-2011)
World's first TV-fashion visual search engine, catalogging tens of popular shows, hundreds of actors/actresses, and many thousands of items.

With two other founding partners from my Chevron days, we designed and built a crowd-sourced search engine to connect TV viewers with the designers and fashion apparel they were seeking.  Before eventually closing the company, we had as many as thirty interns, and were courted by worldwide fashion designers and the CW network.

## Consumer Media Network (2011-2013)
Around the closing of my own startup, I joined the high-caliber team at CMN (then CollegeDegrees.com) to enter the fast-paced (and oft-questionable) world lead-gen and SEO "gaming".  Before eventually leaving for personal reasons, I was introduced to the tech conference life and the excitement of incredibly passionate/talented engineers doing what we do best - engineer things.  Fantastic period that can certainly take credit for propelling me into modern app/software development.

I also gained much respect for Google and their efforts to combat SEO manipulation (which hurt us, but helped the world).

## Quantum Reservoir Impact (2014-2017)
Overhauled the software development efforts of the company.

Originally hired to transform a largely-academic prototype for reservoir diagnostics/analytics from a 10,000-line, spaghetti code single file "application", this turned into a complete rework of how they designed/built software.  After fully modernizing their stack, then architecting and building the initial app, I hired and trained junior talent to take over the project.

## Arundo Analytics (2018-2021)
Led product teams through technical vision, and unified the fragmented (trans-ocean) teams through common prototyping tools and component/build/design systems.  While working towards these goals, I was fortune to work with some of the most fantastic colleagues, many of whom I'm still in touch with today.  Left in late 2021 after launching a major commercial application for industrial monitoring and failure detection.  Super stoked with what we built, and the bar we set for how performant [read: FAST] and slick an "engineering" app could be.

## Slick.af (2020-2021)
Launched a free, public Instagram-clone service for my own uses (as a photographer), around the idea of the lazy photographer/artist being able to drag some files into a folder on their desktop/phone, and a website would magically appear for sharing/viewing those online (in a sexy, magazine-like/iOS sort of way).  Slick accomplishes exactly this.  Submitted this for Y-Combinator in 2021, and will likely revisit after some concept overhaul in 2022.

## Independent Research (2021-2022)
Created a platform for developing/training neuro-evolved continuous control agents for performing a variety of tasks (e.g. drone flight, target-seeking, crypto-trading).  Starting with a sandbox physics simulator to visually confirm that the agents were, in fact, learning what I'd designed them to learn, this "evolved" to a full-blown system for evolving generations of crypto-traders.  Super cool stuff, super fun, and a fun visual demo to those curious/interested!
