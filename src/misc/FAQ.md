## Frequently Asked Questions

<QA>How do I use it?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Install the extension!  That's it (for most users).</QA>

<QA>What's the catch?</QA>
<QA type="answer">There is no catch. It's free. I track nothing, and sell nothing.</QA>

<QA>Do you track my usage/browsing habits?</QA>
<QA type="answer">
  No!  I send no information whatsoever (personally identifying or otherwise) to either retheme.org, or anywhere/anyone else.
</QA>

<QA>What exactly does it do?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Retheme injects site-specific themes, hand-written for that site, to deliver a cleaned-up experience. Usually these simply remove ads, banners, popups, overlays, etc.  Sometimes it goes as far as restructuring the page for better readability.</QA>

<QA>Can I turn it off for a particular site?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Yes!  Open the extension while on the site, and you'll find controls for managing the default and per-site behavior.</QA>

<QA>How is Retheme different from AdBlock?</QA>
<QA type="answer">For one thing, Retheme approaches ad-blocking in a custom per-site way that's simply not possible with AdBlock.  Secondly, AdBlock famously allows certain ad companies to still be seen if they pay AdBlock, defeating the entire purpose for users.  I don't do that here.</QA>

<QA>Should I use AdBlock as well?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Honestly, I recommend using both!  AdBlock blocks (some) of the major ad-campaigns across <em>all</em> sites, while
Retheme applies very custom themes to <em>specific</em> sites (namely high-traffic news/content sites).  They both have their place!</QA>

<QA>Does it remove paywalls (e.g. news sites)?</QA>
<QA type="answer">If I can remove them, I do. I believe blocking basic knowledge of world-events behind pay walls is incredibly anti-consumer, and anti-equality.  A less affluent person should not be *forced* to be less educated.</QA>

<QA>Can I request a retheme for my favorite (spammy) site?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Yes!  You'll have to open the extension while on the site (I recommend pinning it to the toolbar), then hit the blue request link.  I'll prioritize sites by number of requests, so ask your friends to pitch in and vote on the site as well!</QA>

<QA>How does this make you money?</QA>
<QA type="answer">It doesn't!</QA>

<QA>Will you get in trouble for making this?</QA>
<QA type="answer">...</QA>
