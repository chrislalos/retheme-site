## Frequently Asked Questions

<QA>How do I use it?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Install the extension!  That's it (for most users).</QA>

<QA>What's the catch?</QA>
<QA type="answer">There is no catch. It's free. I track nothing, and sell nothing.</QA>

<QA>Do you track my usage/browsing habits?</QA>
<QA type="answer">
  No!  I send no information whatsoever (personally identifying or otherwise) to either retheme.org, or anywhere/anyone else.
</QA>

<QA>What exactly does it do?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Retheme injects site-specific themes, hand-written for that site, to deliver a cleaned-up experience. Usually these simply remove ads, banners, popups, overlays, etc.  Sometimes it goes as far as restructuring the page for better readability.</QA>

<QA>Can I request a theme for a site?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Yes!  You'll have to open the extension while on the site (I recommend pinning it to the toolbar), then hit the blue request link.  I'll prioritize sites by number of requests, so ask your friends to pitch in and vote on the site as well!</QA>

<QA>Can I turn it off the theme for a particular site?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Yes!  Open the extension while on the site, and you'll find controls for managing the default and per-site behavior.</QA>

<QA>How is Retheme different from AdBlock?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Retheme approaches ad-blocking in a custom per-site way that's simply not possible with AdBlock, and does so via styling, rather than universally blocking known ad-offenders (which is why AdBlock is still great).</QA>

<QA>Should I use AdBlock as well?</QA>
<QA type="answer">I recommend using both!  AdBlock blocks (some) of the major ad-campaigns across <em>all</em> sites, while
Retheme applies very custom themes to <em>specific</em> sites (namely high-traffic news/content sites).  They both have their place!</QA>

<QA>Does it remove paywalls (e.g. news sites)?</QA>
<QA type="answer">If I can remove them, I do. I believe blocking basic knowledge of world-events behind pay walls is incredibly anti-consumer, and anti-equality.  A less affluent person should not be *forced* to be less educated.</QA>

<QA>How does this make you money?</QA>
<QA type="answer">It doesn't!</QA>

<QA>I love this!  How can I help?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Help me spread the word by sharing it with friends and on social media!  Eventually, I may accept donations if there's enough interest in supporting this.  I'll even name <strike>my</strike> <em>someone else's</em> child after you as thanks!</QA>

<QA>Will the name stick?</QA>
<QA type="answer">Nah. I doubt it will have any legal binding, plus the parents would keep calling them their old name, so...</QA>

<QA>Will you get in trouble for making this?</QA>
<QA type="answer">...</QA>
